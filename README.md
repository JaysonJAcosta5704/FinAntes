We have developed web applications with frontend and backend technologies, including Vue.js, Vite, Express.js, and many more. Working together, we can create an excellent web application.

## Purpose
Keeping track of finances in today's world can be tricky. People often need to use multiple applications to manage their finances. This can make organizing your finances inconvenient and time-consuming. Our solution to this problem is FinAntes. FinAntes aims to create a centralized platform where users can manage all aspects of their finances. This final project will expand our midterm implementation by moving from a client-side application to a full-stack solution with React, Node.js, and a database backend.
