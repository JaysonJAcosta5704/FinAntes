# FinAntes

We, Jayson Acosta(Jayson04@iastate.edu) and Zaid Rachman(ZaidR@iastate.edu) are from team IP_4. We are engineers with experience in many projects, such as Embedded Systems, Android Development, Web Development, and many more. Our Web Development background includes building websites using React, Typescript, and Traditional Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP). We have developed web applications with frontend and backend technologies, including Vue.js, Vite, Express.js, and many more. Working together, we can create an excellent web application.

## Purpose
Keeping track of finances in today's world can be tricky. People often need to use multiple applications to manage their finances. This can make organizing your finances inconvenient and time-consuming. Our solution to this problem is FinAntes. FinAntes aims to create a centralized platform where users can manage all aspects of their finances. This final project will expand our midterm implementation by moving from a client-side application to a full-stack solution with React, Node.js, and a database backend.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
